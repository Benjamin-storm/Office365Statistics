# Introduction

This project was created with the sole purpose of learning how to integrate a MVVM UWP application with the Microsoft Graph API, therefore being able to contact Office 365.

# Missing
- Recursive call to Graph API to get all nested files

## Maybe will add:
- Add User card in the authentication page after the user has authenticated
- More statistics/charts related to different Office 365 products
- Loading indicator based on the IsLoading property of the View Models
- Unit tests
